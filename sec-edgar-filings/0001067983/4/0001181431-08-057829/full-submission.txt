As OBH and Berkshire are each in the chain of ownership of NICO, each of Berkshire and OBH may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all securities of Burlington Northern presently owned by NICO. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the Burlington Northern securities presently owned by NICO.  Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
