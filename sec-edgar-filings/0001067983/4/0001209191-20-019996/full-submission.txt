        <footnote id="F1">On March 16, 2020, Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;) sold its entire interest in The Buffalo News Corporation which was the sponsor of four pension plans with aggregate DaVita Inc. (&quot;DVA&quot;) holdings between them of 470,000 shares.  At the time of the sale, the market value of the DVA shares owned by the four pension plans was $33,717,800, based on the closing price of DVA common stock that day.  There was no consideration specifically allocated to the DVA Common Stock holdings of the four Buffalo News pension plans in connection with the sale of The Buffalo News Corporation.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">18,513,482 of the total reported securities are owned by the following subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;): Government Employees Insurance Company (11,208,904), GEICO Indemnity Company (6,795,084), GEICO Advantage Insurance Company (223,398), GEICO Choice Insurance Company (222,842), and GEICO Secure Insurance Company (63,254). As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares of Common Stock presently owned by each subsidiary. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares of Common Stock presently owned by each such subsidiary. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">19,582,088 of the total reported securities are owned by the following pension plans of Berkshire's subsidiaries: ACME Brick Company Pension Trust (350,000), Scott Fetzer Company Collective Investment Trust (450,000), BNSF Master Retirement Trust (6,850,000) and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Consolidated Pension Plan (11,932,088); each of Berkshire, Mr. Buffett and these pension plans disclaim beneficial ownership in such shares.</footnote>
