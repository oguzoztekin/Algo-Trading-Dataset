        <footnote id="F1">Acquired in connection with the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &quot;Merger Agreement&quot;), dated as of February 4, 2011, and amended on April 15, 2011, by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation (&quot;Berkshire&quot;), Montana Acquisitions, LLC (&quot;Merger Sub&quot;), a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of BCS Holdings, LLC (&quot;BCS Holdings&quot;), and Wesco Financial Corporation (&quot;Wesco&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Upon completion of the merger of Wesco with and into Merger Sub (the &quot;Merger&quot;), each share of Wesco common stock (other than shares owned by the Reporting Persons) was converted into the right to receive an amount, either in cash or Berkshire Class B common stock, par value $0.0033 per share, at the election of the shareholder, equal to $385.00, calculated in accordance with the Merger Agreement.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Each outstanding share of Wesco common stock was canceled in the Merger.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">BCS Holdings is a subsidiary of OBH LLC (&quot;OBH&quot;), and OBH is a subsidiary of Berkshire. As OBH and Berkshire are each in the chain of ownership of BCS Holdings, each of OBH and Berkshire may be deemed to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all securities of Wesco acquired in the Merger.  Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling shareholder of Berkshire, may be deemed to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares of Wesco common stock acquired in the Merger. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
