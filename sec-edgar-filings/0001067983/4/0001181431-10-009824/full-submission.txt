        <footnote id="F1">As a result of the merger (the &quot;Merger&quot;) of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (&quot;BNSF&quot;) with and into R Acquisition Company, LLC, a subsidiary of National Indemnity Company (&quot;NICO&quot;), on February 12, 2010, each outstanding share of common stock of BNSF, other than shares owned by the Reporting Persons, was converted into the right to receive, at the election of the stockholder (subject to certain proration and reallocation procedures described in the merger agreement), either (i)??$100.00 in cash, or (ii)??a portion of a share of Berkshire Class??A common stock equal to the exchange ratio, which was calculated by dividing $100.00 by the average of the daily volume-weighted average trading prices per share of Berkshire Class??A common stock over the ten trading day period ending on the second full trading day prior to completion of the Merger.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Shares of Berkshire Class B common stock were issued in lieu of fractional shares of Berkshire Class A common stock, and cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares of Berkshire Class B common stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">All of the outstanding common stock of BNSF was canceled in the Merger.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">NICO is a subsidiary of OBH LLC (&quot;OBH&quot;), and OBH is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;).  As OBH and Berkshire are each in the chain of ownership of NICO, each of OBH and Berkshire may be deemed to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all securities of BNSF acquired by NICO.  Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the BNSF shares acquired by NICO.  Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
