        <footnote id="F1">The 10% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (&quot;Notes&quot;) are convertible into shares of Common Stock, $0.10 par value (&quot;Shares&quot;) at an initial conversion price of $11.40 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">These shares are owned by four subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;) as follows: National Indemnity Company (&quot;NICO&quot;) (17,072,192 shares), Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (&quot;BH Nebraska&quot;) (11,403,509 shares), Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation (&quot;BH Assurance&quot;) (6,414,474 shares) and General Re Life Corporation (&quot;General Re Life&quot;) (3,570,614 shares).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">$130 million aggregate principal amount of Notes held by BH Nebraska were converted into 11,403,509 shares of USG Common Stock, $73.125 million aggregate principal amount of Notes held by BH Assurance were converted into 6,414,474 shares of USG Common Stock and $40.705 million aggregate principal amount of Notes held by General Re Life were converted into 3,570,614 shares of USG Common Stock. Such conversions occurred following receipt of notice of redemption of the converted Notes.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">As Berkshire and NICO are each in the chain of ownership of BH Nebraska and BH Assurance, each of Berkshire and NICO may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in the Notes presently owned by BH Nebraska and BH Assurance. As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of General Re Life, Berkshire may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in the Notes presently owned by General Re Life. Warren E. Buffett, as controlling shareholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the Notes presently owned by BH Nebraska, BH Assurance and General Re Life. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
