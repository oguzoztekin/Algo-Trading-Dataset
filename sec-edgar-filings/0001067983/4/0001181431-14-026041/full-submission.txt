        <footnote id="F1">1,618,637 shares of Class B Common Stock were disposed of pursuant to that certain Exchange Agreement (the &quot;Exchange Agreement&quot;), dated as of April 10, 2014, by and among Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;), National Indemnity Company (&quot;NICO&quot;), National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (&quot;NFMIC&quot;), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Company, Graham Holdings Company (the &quot;Issuer&quot;), and Miami Station Split Co.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">In exchange for 1,618,637 shares of Class B Common Stock, Berkshire acquired a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer owning (i) WPLG, a Miami-based television station, (ii) 2,107 shares of Berkshire Class A common stock and 1,278 shares of Berkshire Class B common stock previously held by the Issuer and (iii) $327,717,816 (such transaction, the &quot;Exchange&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">In connection with the Exchange, NICO separately acquired certain interests in a related entity in exchange for 1,553 shares of Class B Common Stock.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">All of the shares of Class B Common Stock transferred pursuant to the reported transactions were owned by NICO, a subsidiary of Berkshire. Of the 107,575 shares owned after these transactions, (i) 59,410 shares are owned by NICO and (ii) 48,165 shares are owned by NFMIC, a subsidiary of Berkshire. As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares of Class B Common Stock presently owned by each such subsidiary. Warren E. Buffett, as controlling shareholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares presently owned by each such subsidiary. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of such shares except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
