        <footnote id="F1">24,532,818 of the total reported shares of Series C Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock are owned as of June 3, 2020 by the following subsidiaries of Berkshire: Government Employees Insurance Company (14,920,260), GEICO Advantage Insurance Company (630,000), GEICO Indemnity Company (3,809,650), National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (508,654), and National Indemnity Company (4,664,254). As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all such shares presently owned by each of these subsidiaries. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, such shares presently owned by each such subsidiary. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">11,159,297 of the total reported shares of Series C Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock are owned as of June 3, 2020 by the following pension plans of Berkshire's subsidiaries: Berkshire Hathaway Consolidated Pension Plan (6,314,225), BNSF Master Retirement Trust (2,673,750), Precision Castparts Corp.
