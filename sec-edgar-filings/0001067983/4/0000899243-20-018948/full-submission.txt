        <footnote id="F1">On March 16, 2020, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;) sold its interest in The Buffalo News, Inc. and therefore is no longer deemed to beneficially own the 481,000 shares of Liberty Global plc Class A Ordinary Shares (&quot;Class A Shares&quot;) that were directly owned by Buffalo News Driver/Distributors Pension Plan (27,000), Buffalo News Editorial Pension Plan (265,000), Buffalo News Mechanical Pension Plan (30,000) and Buffalo News Office Pension Plan (159,000). On March 16, 2020, the market value of the 481,000 Class A Shares held by these plans was $7,493,980, based on the closing per share price that day.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">11,412,000 of the total reported shares of Class A Shares are owned as of July 10, 2020 by the following subsidiaries of Berkshire: Government Employees Insurance Company (8,075,130), GEICO Advantage Insurance Company (1,363,562), GEICO Indemnity Company (1,752,278), and National Indemnity Company (221,030). As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all such shares presently owned by each of these subsidiaries. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, such shares presently owned by each such subsidiary. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">7,898,000 of the total reported Class A Shares are owned as of July 10, 2020 by the following pension plans of Berkshire's subsidiaries: Acme Brick Company Pension Trust (395,000), Berkshire Hathaway Consolidated Pension Plan (3,665,000), BNSF Master Retirement Trust (2,624,000), Precision Castparts Corp. Master Trust (814,000), and Scott Fetzer Collective Investment Trust (400,000). Each of Berkshire, Mr. Buffett and these pension plans disclaims beneficial ownership in such shares.</footnote>
