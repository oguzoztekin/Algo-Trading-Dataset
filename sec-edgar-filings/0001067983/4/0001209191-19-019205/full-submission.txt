        <footnote id="F1">The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. These shares were purchased in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $49.82 to $50.00. The Reporting Persons undertake to provide Delta Air Lines, Inc., any security holder of Delta Air Lines, Inc., or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the range set forth in footnote 1 to this Form 4.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">The total reported securities are owned by the following subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;): National Indemnity Company (63,917,333) and Government Employees Insurance Company (6,993,123). As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares of Common Stock presently owned by each of these subsidiaries. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares of Common Stock presently owned by each such subsidiary. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
