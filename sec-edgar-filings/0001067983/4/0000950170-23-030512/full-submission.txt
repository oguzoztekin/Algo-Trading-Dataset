The Reporting Persons undertake to provide Occidental Petroleum Corporation (&quot;Occidental&quot;), any security holder of Occidental, or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares purchased at each separate price within the range set forth in footnote 1 to this Form 4.</footnote>

        <footnote id="F3">As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each subsidiary listed, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares and derivative securities, as applicable, presently directly owned by such subsidiaries. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares and derivative securities, as applicable, presently owned by each of these subsidiaries. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein. In addition, in order to avoid double counting, all shares and derivative securities, as applicable, reported as being owned by each subsidiary listed only reflect shares or derivative securities, as applicable, that are owned directly by such subsidiary,</footnote>

        <footnote id="F7">The shares of the issuer's preferred stock reported on this form were issued on August 8, 2019 and are held by Berkshire indirectly through its subsidiary, National Indemnity Company. Between June 16, 2023 and June 23, 2023, the issuer redeemed a total of 1,568 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the contractually specified redemption price of $110,000 per share.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F8">The warrants contain provisions that adjust the exercise price and the number of shares of the issuer's common stock issuable on exercise upon the occurrence of certain events. As such, the exercise price and the number of shares of the issuer's common stock issuable on exercise as reported on this form are subject to change upon the occurrence of future events in accordance with the terms of the warrants. The warrants were initially for 80,000,000 shares with an initial exercise price of $62.50 per share. On June 26, 2020, the issuer's board of directors declared a distribution to its common shareholders of warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock, which distribution resulted in an anti-dilution adjustment to the warrants, which lowered the exercise price to $59.624 and increased the number of shares issuable on exercise of the warrants to 83,858,848.81.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F9">The warrants were issued on August 8, 2019 and are exercisable at the applicable holder's option, in whole or in part, until the first anniversary of the date on which no shares of the issuer's series A preferred stock remain outstanding, at which time the warrants expire.</footnote>
