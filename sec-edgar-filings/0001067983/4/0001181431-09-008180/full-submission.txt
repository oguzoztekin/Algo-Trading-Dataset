        <footnote id="F1">The 10% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (&quot;Notes&quot;) are convertible into shares of Common Stock, $0.10 par value (&quot;Shares&quot;) at an initial conversion price of $11.40 per share, subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Following stockholder approval of the issuance of Shares upon conversion of the Notes at a special meeting of stockholders held on February 9, 2009, the Notes became convertible into Shares at the option of the holder thereof at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the final maturity date of the Notes (December 1, 2018), unless the Notes are earlier repurchased or redeemed by the Issuer.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Subject to adjustment.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F4">$160 million aggregate principal amount of Notes is held by Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (&quot;BH Nebraska&quot;), $90 million aggregate principal amount of Notes is held by Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corporation (&quot;BH Assurance&quot;), and $50 million aggregate principal amount of Notes is held by General Re Life Corporation (&quot;General Re Life&quot;).</footnote>
        <footnote id="F5">(Footnote 4 contd.) As Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;), OBH, Inc. (&quot;OBH&quot;), and National Indemnity Company (&quot;NICO&quot;) are each in the chain of ownership of BH Nebraska and BH Assurance, each of Berkshire, OBH and NICO may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in the Notes presently owned by BH Nebraska and BH Assurance. As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of General Re Life, Berkshire may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in the Notes presently owned by General Re Life.  Warren E. Buffett, as controlling shareholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the Notes presently owned by BH Nebraska, BH Assurance and General Re Life.  Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
