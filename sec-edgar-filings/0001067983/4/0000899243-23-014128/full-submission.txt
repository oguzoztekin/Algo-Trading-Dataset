        <footnote id="F3">As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each subsidiary listed, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares and derivative securities, as applicable, presently directly owned by such subsidiaries. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares and derivative securities, as applicable, presently owned by each of these subsidiaries. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein. In addition, in order to avoid double counting, all shares and derivative securities, as applicable, reported as being owned by each subsidiary listed only reflect shares or derivative securities, as applicable, that are owned directly by such subsidiary,</footnote>

        <footnote id="F8">The warrants contain provisions that adjust the exercise price and the number of shares of the issuer's common stock issuable on exercise upon the occurrence of certain events. As such, the exercise price and the number of shares of the issuer's common stock issuable on exercise as reported on this form are subject to change upon the occurrence of future events in accordance with the terms of the warrants. The warrants were initially for 80,000,000 shares with an initial exercise price of $62.50 per share. On June 26, 2020, the issuer's board of directors declared a distribution to its common shareholders of warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock, which distribution resulted in an anti-dilution adjustment to the warrants, which lowered the exercise price to $59.624 and increased the number of shares issuable on exercise of the warrants to 83,858,848.81.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F9">The warrants were issued on August 8, 2019 and are exercisable at the applicable holder's option, in whole or in part, until the first anniversary of the date on which no shares of the issuer's series A preferred stock remain outstanding, at which time the warrants expire.</footnote>
