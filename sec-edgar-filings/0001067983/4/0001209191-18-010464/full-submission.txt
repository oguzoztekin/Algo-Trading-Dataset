        <footnote id="F1">39,587,892 of the total reported securities are owned by the following subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;): National Indemnity Co. (28,291,892), National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. (1,163,000), National Liability &amp; Fire Insurance Co. (1,266,000), Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp. (1,558,000), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Co. (782,000), Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Co. (1,314,000) and Columbia Insurance Company (5,213,000).  As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares of Common Stock presently owned by these each of these subsidiaries.  Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares of Common Stock presently owned by each such subsidiary.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">Continuation of Footnote 1: Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.  Footnote 2: 6,102,000 of the total reported securities are owned by the following pension plans of Berkshire's subsidiaries: Berkshire Hathaway Consolidated Pension Plan Master Trust (3,602,300) and GEICO Corporation Pension Plan Trust (2,499,700).
