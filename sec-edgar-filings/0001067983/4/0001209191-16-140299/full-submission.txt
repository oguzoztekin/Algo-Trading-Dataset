        <footnote id="F1">The price reported in Column 4 is a weighted average price. These shares were purchased in multiple transactions at prices ranging from $77.66 to $78.00. The
Reporting Persons undertake to provide Phillips 66, any security holder of Phillips 66, or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the range set forth in footnote 1 to this Form 4.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">73,550,008 of the total reported securities are owned by the following subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;): National Indemnity Co. (62,254,008), National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co. (1,163,000), National Liability &amp; Fire Insurance Co. (1,266,000), Berkshire Hathaway Assurance Corp. (1,558,000), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Insurance Co. (782,000), Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance Co. (1,314,000) and Columbia Insurance Company (5,213,000). As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares of Common Stock presently owned by each of these subsidiaries. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares of Common Stock presently owned by each such subsidiary.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">Continuation of Footnote 2: Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein. Footnote 3: 6,102,000 of the total reported securities are owned by the following pension plans of Berkshire's subsidiaries: FlightSafety International Inc. Retirement Income Plan (350,000), Fruit of the Loom Pension Trust (921,300), GEICO Corporation Pension Plan Trust (2,499,700), Johns Manville Corporation Master Pension Trust (2,187,000) and General Re Corp.
