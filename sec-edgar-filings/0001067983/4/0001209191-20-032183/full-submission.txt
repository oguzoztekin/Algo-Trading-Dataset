        <footnote id="F1">10,552,243 of the total reported shares of Series A Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock are owned as of May 26, 2020 by the following subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;): Government Employees Insurance Company (5,558,855), GEICO Advantage Insurance Company (262,500), GEICO Indemnity Company (1,970,425), National Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Company (933,391), and National Indemnity Company (1,827,072). As Berkshire is in the chain of ownership of each of these subsidiaries, it may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all such shares presently owned by each of these subsidiaries. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling stockholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, such shares presently owned by each such subsidiary. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">4,308,117 of the total reported shares of Series A Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock are owned as of May 26, 2020 by the following pension plans of Berkshire's subsidiaries: Berkshire Hathaway Consolidated Pension Plan (1,685,000), BNSF Master Retirement Trust (936,000) and Precision Castparts Corp. Master Trust (1,687,117).  Shares previously reported as being owned by GEICO Corporation Pension Plan Trust (500,000), General Re Corp. Employee Retirement Trust (100,000), Johns Manville Corporation Master Pension Trust (410,000), and Lubrizol Corp Master Trust Pension (150,000) (collectively, the &quot;Merged Entities&quot;) were transferred to Berkshire Hathaway Consolidated Pension Plan in connection with the merger of the Merged Entities with and into Berkshire Hathaway Consolidated Pension Plan.  Each of Berkshire, Mr. Buffett and these pension plans disclaims beneficial ownership in such shares.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">In Berkshire and Warren E. Buffett's Form 4 filing of May 31, 2017, 41,500 shares of Series C Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock were inadvertently reported as being owned by the Benjamin Moore &amp; Company Revised Retirement Income Plan. These shares were in fact owned by the Buffalo News Editorial Pension Plan, in addition to the 133,500 shares of Series C Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock it reported owning in the Form 4 filing of May 31, 2017. On March 16, 2020, Berkshire sold its interest in The Buffalo News, Inc. and therefore is no longer deemed to beneficially own the 240,000 shares of Series C Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock that were directly owned by the Buffalo News Editorial Pension Plan (175,000) and the Buffalo News Office Pension Plan (65,000). On March 16, 2020, the market value of the 240,000 shares of Series C Liberty SiriusXM Common Stock held by these plans was $7,029,600, based on the closing per share price that day.</footnote>
