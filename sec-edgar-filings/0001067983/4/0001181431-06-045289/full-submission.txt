        <footnote id="F1">These shares are owned by National Indemnity Company (&quot;NICO&quot;), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (&quot;Berkshire&quot;)</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">As Berkshire and OBH, Inc. (&quot;OBH&quot;), a subsidiary to Berkshire, are each in the chain of ownership of NICO, each of Berkshire and OBH may be deemed presently to both beneficially own and have a pecuniary interest in all shares of USG Corporation (&quot;USG&quot;) common stock presently owned by NICO. Warren E. Buffett, as the controlling shareholder of Berkshire, may be deemed presently to beneficially own, but only to the extent he has a pecuniary interest in, the shares of USG common stock presently owned by NICO. Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F3">On January 30, 2006, Berkshire entered into an Equity Commitment Agreement with USG wherein Berkshire agreed, among other things, to provide a backstop commitment to purchase unsubscribed shares in a rights offering by USG to its shareholders, and USG agreed to sell such unsubscribed shares to Berkshire or a subsidiary of Berkshire. Following the expiration of the rights offering, NICO purchased 6,969,274 shares on August 2, 2006, in accordance with the Equity Commitment Agreement.</footnote>
