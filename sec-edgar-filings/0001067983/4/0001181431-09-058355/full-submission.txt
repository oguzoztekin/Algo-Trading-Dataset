The reporting person undertakes to provide to Moody's Corporation, any security holder of Moody's Corporation, or the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission, upon request, full information regarding the number of shares sold at each separate price within the ranges set forth in this footnote 1 to this Form 4.</footnote>
        <footnote id="F2">16,095,210 of these shares are owned by National Indemnity Company (&quot;NICO&quot;), and 15,719,400 of these shares are owned by Government Employees Insurance Company (&quot;GEICO&quot;). GEICO is a subsidiary of GEICO Corporation, and GEICO Corporation is a subsidiary of NICO.  NICO is a subsidiary of OBH, Inc. (&quot;OBH&quot;).  OBH is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
