(&quot;Berkshire&quot;): National Indemnity Company (393,043), Government Employees Insurance Company (20,000,000) and GEICO Advantage Insurance Company (546,957).

Mr. Buffett disclaims beneficial ownership of the reported securities except to the extent of his
pecuniary interest therein.</footnote>
